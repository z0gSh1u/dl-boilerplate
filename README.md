# dl-boilerplate

This is the template I used to build a deep-learning project. It originates from [my undergraduate thesis project](https://github.com/z0gSh1u/graduation-project) .

## Folder Structure

- baseline: For baseline experiments.
- experiments: For other experiments rather than train-validate-test.
- nova: The model you create or improve.
- paper: For paperwork. Better import to overleaf.
- script: For running at server side.
- useful: Useful utilities.

## Derive from This

Click "Use this template" on GitHub.

Or:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:z0gSh1u/dl-boilerplate.git
```
